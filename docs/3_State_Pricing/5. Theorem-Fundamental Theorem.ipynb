    "Points (i) and (ii) are linked, as the existence of an asset pricing model requires strictly positive state prices and no arbitrage opportunities, with one condition implying the other.  \n",
    "Point (iii) suggests that if arbitrage opportunities exist, a representative investor's maximization problem would lack an optimum, as buying more in a state with a negative price could infinitely increase wealth and unbounded expected utility."

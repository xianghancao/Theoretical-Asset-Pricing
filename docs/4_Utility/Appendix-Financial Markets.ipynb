    "## Core Assumption\n",
    "Core Assumption: Investors prefer a smooth consumption stream across both time and different states of nature.\n",
    "- Time Dimension: Investors aim to avoid sharp fluctuations in consumption over periods. Example: Given two plans with equal total consumption (12 units), investors prefer {6, 6} over {2, 10} for smoother consumption.\n",
    "- Risk Dimension: Investors prefer consistent consumption across possible future states. Example: Given two plans with equal expected consumption (11 units) across four equally likely states, investors favor a plan with uniform consumption over one with high variability (e.g., 20 units in one state, 4 in another).\n",

    "Role of Financial Markets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time: Borrowing allows increased consumption today at the expense of future consumption, while investing in assets (e.g., risk-free) shifts consumption to the future, with the risk-free rate as compensation for delay.\n",
    "- Risk: Assets with variable payoffs help diversify consumption risk. Example: An investor with a risky consumption plan {9, 20, 12, 8, 4} prefers an asset with payoffs {1, 2, 3, 4} (high payoffs when consumption is low) over {4, 3, 2, 1} (high payoffs when consumption is high), as it reduces consumption variability.\n"

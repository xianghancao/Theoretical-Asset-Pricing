    "1. State Pricing: Asset prices are determined by their state-contingent payoffs weighted by state prices, $ P = D^T y $.\n",
    "2. Arrow-Debreu Securities: Fundamental building blocks that pay 1 in a specific state, with prices $ y_s $ reflecting the value of state-contingent payoffs.\n",
    "3. Market Completeness: Requires $ \\text{rank}(D) = S $, ensuring enough independent assets to price all states uniquely, allowing state prices to be derived via $ y = (D^T)^{-1} P $.\n",
    "4. Practical Relevance: While Arrow-Debreu securities are theoretical, their prices can be inferred in complete markets, underpinning modern asset pricing models."

    "- State Prices: Represent the price of one unit of payoff in a specific state, enabling valuation of any asset via its state-contingent payoffs.\n",
    "- Market Completeness: Ensures all state-contingent claims can be replicated, allowing precise pricing and risk hedging.\n",
    "- Reverse Decomposition: In complete markets, state prices can be inferred from observed asset prices and payoffs, a critical tool for asset pricing theory.\n",

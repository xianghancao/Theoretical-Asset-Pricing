    "Early Tests (1960–1980):\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported CAPM, showing higher-beta portfolios had higher returns, but test portfolios may not have been robust.\n",

    "Modern Tests (Post-1980s):\n",
    "\n",
    "Banz (1981): Small-cap stocks yielded higher returns than CAPM predicted.\n",
    "Fama and French (1992): Value stocks (high book-to-market ratios) outperformed CAPM predictions.\n",
    "Test Data (1960–2020, 25 portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market):\n",
    "\n",
    "Value premium: Value stocks had higher returns but lower betas, contradicting CAPM.\n",
    "Cross-sectional regression showed a weak relationship between beta and returns (R² = 16%).\n",

    "Roll’s (1977) Critique:\n",
    "\n",
    "CAPM’s only testable implication is that the market portfolio is mean-variance efficient.\n",
    "If the proxy (e.g., CRSP value-weighted index) is not efficient, alphas are non-zero, leading to CAPM’s failure.\n",

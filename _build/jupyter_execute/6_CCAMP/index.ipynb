    "\n",
    "1. CCAPM Framework: Links asset prices to consumption via the SDF $ z_{t+1} = \\delta \\frac{u'(c_{t+1})}{u'(c_t)} $, with prices given by $ P_{t,i} = E_t[z_{t+1} D_{t+1,i}] $ or returns by $ 1 = E_t[z_{t+1} R_{t+1,i}] $.\n",
    "2. Economic Intuition: Investors value assets based on their ability to smooth consumption. Assets with high payoffs in low-consumption states (high marginal utility) have higher prices and lower expected returns.\n",
    "3. Risk Corrections: Expected returns compensate for risk based on covariance with marginal utility (or consumption). Risky assets (positively correlated with consumption) require higher returns; hedging assets (negatively correlated) may have lower returns.\n",
    "4. Link to CAPM: CCAPM reduces to CAPM under the strong assumption that the market portfolioâ€™s return is perfectly negatively correlated with marginal utility, aligning expected returns with market beta.\n",
    "5. Empirical Testability: CCAPM provides a framework to test asset pricing models by proxying the SDF with consumption data, unlike relative pricing models."
